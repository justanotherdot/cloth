# Bet 001: Remix for Control Plane UI

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Status**: Active  
**Champion**: System Architecture  

## Hypothesis

**"Remix will accelerate control plane development velocity by 3x compared to Vite+React as feature complexity grows"**

Specifically:
- **Form-heavy interfaces** (flag creation, targeting rules) will be faster to build and maintain
- **File-based routing** will scale better than manual route management
- **Progressive enhancement** will provide better UX resilience for admin interfaces
- **Built-in patterns** will reduce boilerplate for data loading, error handling, and validation

## Context

Control plane UI will evolve from simple flag list to complex admin interface:
- Flag creation/editing with validation
- Targeting rules (user segments, percentages, A/B tests)
- Analytics dashboards
- User management and permissions
- Audit logs and environment promotion
- Real-time flag evaluation testing

Current Vite+React setup works for basic use cases but will require significant additional tooling as complexity grows.

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative (6 months)**:
- ✅ **Development velocity**: New admin features take <2 days vs estimated 5+ days with Vite+React
- ✅ **Code maintenance**: <20% time spent on form state management vs estimated 40% with manual solutions
- ✅ **Performance**: Admin interface loads in <1s vs current 2-3s client-only rendering

**Qualitative**:
- ✅ **Developer experience**: New team members can add admin features within 1 week
- ✅ **User experience**: Forms work without JavaScript, fast with JavaScript
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear patterns for data loading, error handling, and validation

## Decision Gates

**Month 1**: Basic flag CRUD operations implemented
- If taking >3 days to implement flag creation form → re-evaluate
- If form state management becomes complex → re-evaluate

**Month 3**: Advanced features (targeting, analytics)  
- If routing becomes unwieldy → re-evaluate
- If data loading patterns are unclear → re-evaluate

**Month 6**: Full admin interface
- If bundle size >500kb → consider optimization or alternatives
- If SSR causing deployment issues → consider static generation

## Kill Criteria

**Immediate kill signals**:
- ❌ Remix deployment to Cloudflare Pages fails or requires workarounds
- ❌ Bundle size exceeds 1MB without clear optimization path
- ❌ Development hot reload becomes slower than 3 seconds

**6-month evaluation**:
- ❌ Development velocity has not improved vs baseline
- ❌ Team consistently prefers manual React patterns over Remix patterns
- ❌ Performance is worse than client-only alternative

## Evaluation Framework

**Monthly measurement**:
- Feature development time (tracked via tickets)
- Bug rate in admin interface
- Performance metrics (Lighthouse scores)
- Developer satisfaction survey

**Success = 2/3 criteria met by Month 6**

## Rollback Plan

If kill criteria are met:
1. **Immediate**: Revert to Vite+React using git history
2. **Gradual**: Migrate Remix routes back to React components
3. **Alternative**: Evaluate Next.js or SvelteKit if Remix-specific issues

Cost: ~1-2 weeks to rollback, minimal risk due to shared React components.

## Risk Mitigation

**Deployment risk**: Test Remix → Cloudflare Pages early (Month 1)  
**Performance risk**: Implement bundle analysis and progressive loading  
**Learning curve risk**: Start with simple routes, gradually adopt advanced patterns  
**Lock-in risk**: Keep business logic in shared utilities, minimize Remix-specific code  

## Expected Outcomes

**Month 1**: Basic admin interface with 2-3 routes  
**Month 3**: Complex forms and data loading patterns established  
**Month 6**: Full-featured admin interface with analytics, user management  

This bet positions us for rapid control plane evolution while maintaining clear exit criteria and measurable success metrics.
